It's been a little while since I've done one of these, but as I try to get back into the habit of writing and blogging again, I figure that this is more then an opportune time to do it!!

### WORK

For just shy of 10 months this year, I was working at **carconnect** as a _Tech Support Engineer_.  
In September, my role was made redundant, and I left the company after an 11 month tenure. I faced plenty of ups and downs whilst in the job, but enjoyed plenty of the professional challenges and new found knowledge that I gained working there including:

- Salesforce administration
- Microsoft Office 365 administration
- Atlassian Suite Management
  - Jira Service Management
  - Confluence

### FAMILY

My two nephews **Lucas** and **Micah** are 7 and 4 respectively. We try to see them with my sister and brother-in-law once a week for family dinner.

### PHOTOGRAPHY - **SAM LAW**

By and large, most of my time and effort has been invested into my photography.  
One of the biggest achievements of the year was shooting for **World Time Attack Challenge** as one of their 3 official photographers. It was a long 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> 18 hour days, but we came away with some really great work, solidified and established some relationships.

Travel was on the cards for photos this year:

- 5 Rounds of **Hi-Tec Drifting Allstars** Series (2 x _Winton (VIC)_, 2 x _Calder Park (VIC)_, _Queensland Raceway (QLD)_)
- Adelaide Motorsport Festival (for _DriftingSA_)
- Bathurst 6 Hour
- Bathurst International
- LZ World Tour

I've had the pleasure of working with **Autohaus Hamilton** for all of their _Cars & Coffee_ throughout the year, along with **North Shore Sporting Car Club** for **_Collecting Cars_** _AutoBrunch_ and was also one of 2 official shooters for **SubiNats**. And I shot a wedding!!

About halfway through the year I purchased a new camera; a **FujiFilm** _GFX100S_ which is a "_Medium Format_" [_Large Format_] camera boasting an effective 102 MP. It's been a great learning curve to adjust to using it; as it's quite a bit slower than using my **Nikon** _D850_, but has taught me to slow down and focus on creating shots.

### GENERAL LIFE

I got along to 2 **Semi-Permanent** Fesitvals this year - the normal one in Sydney, and then to a second session in Melbourne where they partnered with **Now or Never** to bring us **NEVER&copy;PERMANENT**

Gig wise, there were a few, but seeing **Flight Facilities** play _Sydney Town Hall_ for their **_Decades Tour_** was nothing short of magical!!! **Harbourlife** was an interesting one this year. For the first time in 25 years of heading to gigs, I was searched for the possession of drugs, which was just a stupid inconvenience, but after that little ordeal, seeing **Braxe** & **Falcon** blitz the dancefloor with decades of amazing tunes that they've had a hand in was amazing!!

_Moro The Stagea_ finally landed herself some new wheels (after 8 years of ownership)!! She is sporting some 20" R35 GTR Rims (1st Gen), with some BC Racing Gold coilovers and looking tough!!! I've been casually chatting to some people about her next evolution as well, but that seems like a distant dream.

#### TRAKT

[TRAKT Year In Review](https://trakt.tv/users/300chong/year/2023) I watch waaay too much TV & Movies..... I think my Plex and Trakt screwed up through the year, so this is probably not comprehensive either.....

#### Apple Music

[Apple Music Replay](https://music.apple.com/au/playlist/replay-2023/pl.rp-BooyteWlpx) I think Apple Music would be my subscription of choice. I have such a long standing history with it, that it hasn't made sense to jump ship to Spotify, so here's my **Replay 2023**. I do, however, also use _Soundcloud_, _Beatport_, _Bandcamp_, & _Mixcloud_.

## NEXT YEAR

Who knows what the future brings??  
I'd love to get back into some fitness, probably running.  
I have plans to self publish a book or 2 - coffee table books of photos.  
I'm looking at the possibility of shooting a round or 2 of **D1NZ**, along with some other photographic travels.

I need to get myself back into the work force again.  
I'll be continuing to write and publish here semi-regularly, along with refreshing/importing a back catalogue of posts dating back to 2005, and making some improvements (comments, maybe a launchpad and recommendations etc).

Happy New Year!!!
