March has been a big month for me and Sony. I went and grabbed a Playstation 3 at the midnight launch on the 23rd of March. It's such a great machine and I'm loving it.  
At launch I picked up and extra controller and _Virtua Fighter 5_ along with my PS3. I've been playing that on Quest mode using Sarah, which has been alright, gets a bit repetitive though... There is a HUGE list of moves that can be used, but half of them don't work 80% of the time, so it's just easier using the others.

Other games I have are _Mortal Kombat: Armageddon_, _B-Boy_, _Burnout Dominator_, _Gran Turismo 4_ and _Final Fantasy XII_ for PS2 and _NBA Street Homecourt_ for PS3.
They've been very entertaining and seem to be consuming a tonne of my time, especially _Final Fantasy XII_ of late.

Second Sony in March was a 40" X Series Bravia LCD TV, has a built in HD tuner and sits nicely against a wall in my room atop an **IKEA** cabinet. It's also taking up most of my time, I get to watch the AFL in High Definition, which looks real nice, plus the movies on TV also seem to be showing in High Definition and looking very pretty.

I'm looking forward to combining the PS3 and the TV to watch some Blu-Ray movies. Sony is due to send out _Casino Royale_ on Blu-Ray when it's released, so that shall be good and hopefully there'll be plenty more of those surfacing in the near future as well.
