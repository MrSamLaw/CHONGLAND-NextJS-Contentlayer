Party season has 'officially' kicking off with **Harbourlife** yesterday.

This year the stage moved from the north end of Mrs Macquarie's Chair to a floating barge on the water, which meant a wider dancefloor, but shallower. This also meant less speaker stacks, which were confined to the stage area, but production still remained pretty high with ample lighting fixtures, flame turrets and fireworks.

On the lineup were **Cloonee**, **Claptone**, **Deep Dish**, **D.O.D**., **Riordan**, **Rossi**., **DJ Sophia**, and **Tiff Cornish**. I didn't make it in untill just after 3pm, so missed **Sophia** and **Cornish**. **Riordan** had just kicked off with a blend of house and UKG, but the tracks were short with quick transitions. **Claptone** jumped up next with plenty of great tracks, quickly followed by **D.O.D.** who dropped a great set of party anthems.

By the time **Deep Dish** jumped on stage, the heavens had opened up a couple of times to get the crowds moist. They dropped a nice deep remix of _Say Hello_ early on, which sadly wasn't well recognised by the crowd. As if perfectly times, the heavens again opened up with a heavy downpour during their version of _Dreams_ to a very appreciative crowd.

**Cloonee** finished off the night with plenty of anthems as well and some more heavy rain.

Year on year as we keep heading to **Harbourlife** we see less familiar faces; more random people that are there to be seen and have less and less idea about the music and how festivals work. I had a couple of people step into my personal space and then have a go at me for continually pushing them as I danced, one guy even threatened to hit me if I kept on going. Yet we still turn up, dance up a storm, come home sore and ready to go again next year, hoping for some more decent house music all day long!!
